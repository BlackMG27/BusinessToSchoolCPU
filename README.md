# BusinessToSchoolCPU
Hack To Future Group at Cleverbridge

Business to School CPU is a product for connecting businesses with unused/no longer used computer hardware to students that need them.

This was my group's project for Cleverbridge's Hack to the Future Hackathon. The product was designed to match business with unused computers to families with constricted resources.

My role was to help Stephanie with turning Jordan's design into front-end code using HTML5, CSS3, (and for the first time) ReactJS and SASS.
